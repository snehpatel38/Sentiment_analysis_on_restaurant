       " 'Very nice breakfast/brunch spot. We got the Dutch and vege breakfast plates for lunch on a rainy day. We had about a 15 minute wait on a weekday afternoon for lunch, guessing this place gets reallly popular over the weekends. It was close to the museums and the Heineken experience, so we made a pit stop here for lunch.The food was great, clean and fresh! Since they were so busy, it took forever to get the food. So if you are trying to keep an appointment, think twice.',\n",
       " 'Bakers & Roasters was so good, we went two days in a row! The portions are huge so my fiance and I shared a meal both times. For food, we had the Huevos Rancheros the first day (really good but more like a tostada) with the breakkie potatoes. We tried the Navajo Eggs the second day with sausage and their breakkie potatoes. This was our favorite meal. Everything was delicious and fresh. Their fresh sour cream is so good! For drinks, we tried their mimosas, margaritas, and White Russian. All were consistently good on both days. The White Russian was my favorite - they added caramel/toffee pieces on top which were so good! They get pretty busy, so arriving early is recommended. The service was fantastic - everyone was very friendly and the food/drinks all came out quickly. We sat on the patio both times to enjoy the nice weather. They were super dog-friendly, too! We will definitely be back!Meals, drinks, and the outside patio area are pictured below.',\n",
       " \"Came here for brunch one morning when I was in Amsterdam a couple of weeks ago. I came early enough that there wasn't a wait, nor did I need a reservation. I got their vege brekkie along with an iced latte. My food came out pretty quickly and I was pleased with my selection - the toast was amazing, the ingredients fresh, and all the components of this dish came together great. My coffee was quite good, and service was very attentive all throughout my time here. I have a feeling that you probably can't go too wrong with any of their items, and I'd certainly recommend anybody to come by here if they happen to find themselves in this part of town.\",\n",
       " \"Very nice on first impression! Greeted and seated in less than 2 minutes. This is a nice breakfast/brunch spot for two. The seating inside is really tight yet it still didn't feel overcrowded or too noisy.There were some good selections on the menu but I decided on the French toast with a side of scrambled eggs. The French toast was amazing! Good enough that I'll likely go back before leaving Amsterdam.There were a few different servers in rotation and they checked in often. There were no delays in service at all. I did have an espresso martini which paired very well with my meal.\",\n",
       " \"Really solid brunch place in a convenient part of town.  Portions were generous, but nothing felt too heavy; every component of our dishes felt fresh and healthful.  I'm not vegetarian but the veggie brekkie sounded delicious, and it was!Staff were friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was both calm but energizing; it was a great way to start the day.\",\n",

We arrived right at 10 on a Sunday morning and it was a steady crowd, but there was a wait by the time we left. We were in and out of the restaurant in under an hour and it was some of the fastest service I've seen in Europe. The food could not have been better and we both thoroughly enjoyed what we ordered. We also enjoyed our drinks. The waitress was very friendly as well. My only pet peeve that could have made the meal better would have been to of had another foot of spacing from the other tables in each side of us. My wife and I were laughing about the discussion the people next to us were having after we left the restaurant. Would happily eat here regularly if I lived nearby.\",\n",

       "\"Came here for brunch one morning when I was in Amsterdam a couple of weeks ago. I came early enough that there wasn't a wait, nor did I need a reservation. I got their vege brekkie along with an iced latte. My food came out pretty quickly and I was pleased with my selection - the toast was amazing, the ingredients fresh, and all the components of this dish came together great. My coffee was quite good, and service was very attentive all throughout my time here. I have a feeling that you probably can't go too wrong with any of their items, and I'd certainly recommend anybody to come by here if they happen to find themselves in this part of town.\""
